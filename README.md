This project is a homage to Super Mario Bros. It does not, however, contain ANY original Nintendo content, nor is it an exact implementation of Super Mario Bros.

The goal is to get a somewhat working Super Mario-like DEMO implemented with ARKit and SceneKit.

Why was this made? For fun :)

In this project I have experimented a bit with displacement maps (a new iOS 11 BETA feature of SceneKit).

This obviously requires, Xcode 9 (BETA), iOS 11 (BETA) and a relatively recent iOS device.

You can pretty much do want you want with the code, but please provide attribution, also if you use it to create a video.
